## How to install Flask and run the app
- py -3 -m venv .venv
- .venv\scripts\activate
- pip install Flask
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python app.py

Please note there are some unnecessary dependencies in requirements.txt which I will clean-up later.
This repo is helpful to understand flask => https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/flask-starter-app

Currently it's obviously super basic. I wanted to setup a base flask app to start with. Please feel free to add/edit/delete anythings.
